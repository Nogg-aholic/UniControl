## 🔴 Critical Implementation Issues (HACS/HA Non-Compliance)

### 1. **Missing Required Manifest Fields** ✅ FIXED
- ✅ Added `"integration_type": "helper"` (required by HA)
- ✅ Removed deprecated `homeassistant` version field

### 2. **Incorrect HACS.json Structure** ✅ FIXED
- ✅ Removed invalid fields: `"domains"`, `"iot_class"`
- ✅ Kept only required HACS metadata

### 3. **Missing Home Assistant Brands** ❌ STILL REQUIRED
- Integration must be added to home-assistant/brands repository
- Required for UI standards compliance in HA core (not critical for custom integration)

### 4. **Frontend Registration Wrong** ✅ FIXED
- ✅ Removed deprecated `add_extra_js_url` method
- ✅ HACS will handle frontend resource registration automatically

### 5. **Service Implementation Missing** ✅ PARTIALLY FIXED
- ✅ Added `create_entity` service implementation
- ⚠️ Service creates config entries but needs testing

### 6. **Config Flow Issues** ✅ IMPROVED
- ✅ Fixed unique ID generation (now uses domain.name format)
- ⚠️ Still needs better validation and error handling

### 7. **Entity Registration Wrong** ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED
- ✅ Entities stored in `hass.data` for service access
- ⚠️ Still needs proper entity removal cleanup
- ⚠️ Service-to-entity communication needs refinement

## ⚠️ Limitations & Missing Features

### TypeScript Execution Engine
- [ ] **Real JavaScript Engine**: Currently uses Python eval() with basic JS-to-Python conversion
- [ ] **Better Security**: Sandboxing and input validation
- [ ] **More APIs**: File system, HTTP requests, advanced Date functions
- [ ] **Async Support**: Better handling of async/await in user code

### Template System
- [ ] **Advanced Templating**: Currently basic string replacement
- [ ] **Conditional Logic**: if/else statements in templates
- [ ] **Loops**: for/while loops in templates
- [ ] **Filters**: Date formatting, number formatting, etc.

### User Interface
- [ ] **Visual Code Editor**: Monaco Editor or similar for TypeScript editing
- [ ] **Live Preview**: Real-time preview of HTML/CSS changes
- [ ] **Syntax Highlighting**: Better code editing experience
- [ ] **Entity Management UI**: Create/edit/delete entities through UI

### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Entity Import/Export**: Backup and restore configurations
- [ ] **Templates Library**: Pre-built templates and examples
- [ ] **Performance Monitoring**: Execution time tracking
- [ ] **Debugging Tools**: Step-through debugging, variable inspection

### Error Handling
- [ ] **User-Friendly Errors**: Better error messages for common issues
- [ ] **Validation**: Input validation for HTML/CSS/TypeScript
- [ ] **Rollback**: Revert to previous working configuration on errors

## 🎯 Current State Summary
